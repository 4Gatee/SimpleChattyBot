In this pictures you can view how that bot works.

1. Start. Bot says it's name and create date.
2. Greeting. Bot ask your name, wait for you to type and then answer ("What a great name you have...").
3. Age. Bot ask you to type reminders of dividing your age, then calculate and prints out message according to your age.
4. Count number. Bot ask you to type any number and then it counts from zero to this number. The number can be positive or negative.
5. Quiz. Bot ask you a simple question about methods in programming languages, wait for your answer and congatulate your if the answer was correct, than wishes a nice day and exit.

In all stages there are some test of input data (e.g. your age can't be negative, or your name can't be longer than 40 ch).
